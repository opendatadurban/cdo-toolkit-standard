title: 7. Use common identifiers, data standards and design patterns
---

## Why itâ€™s important

If data is stored using different identifiers or formats (for example using multiple geospatial standards), data needs to be transformed before it can be used. Using proprietary identifiers and standards can limit the reuse of data. Using multiple design patterns for presenting data means users have to learn different interfaces, which can mean that accessibility requirements are inconsistently met.

## What it means
* Engaging in city-wide processes to agree on common data standards and identifiers.
* Making explicit decisions not to link certain datasets.
