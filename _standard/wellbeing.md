title: 8. Protect the safety, privacy and wellbeing of residents
---

## Why itâ€™s important

How data is collected and used can have implications for the safety, privacy and wellbeing of residents. The full range of risks may not be apparent to analysts or service teams and may change over time.

## What it means
* Assessing risks throughout the development process using gender, equity and social inclusion principles.
* Providing feedback systems and 'early warning systems' where concerns can be reported and acted on.
