## Why itâ€™s important

If service teams and analysts don't know what data the city holds, can't access it, or have to spend time reformatting it, then the needs of users go unmet.

## What it means

* There is a public catalogue of the [foundational datasets](https://www.bizmanualz.com/library/what-does-foundational-data-mean) that the city holds along with a description of each field.
* Users know where the catalogue exists and can access it depending on their needs.
