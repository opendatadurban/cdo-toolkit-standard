title: 12. Work in multidisciplinary teams

## Why it’s important

You’ll need a team made up of people with a diverse mix of skills and expertise.

It’s important that people who are involved in decision making are part of the team, so they’re accountable to the team - and the team as a whole can respond quickly to what they learn about users and their needs.

## What it means

* A team that’s appropriate to achieve the desired outcomes.
* The work is the primary focus of the team.
* Include people on the team with expertise in how services are delivered across all the relevant offline channels, and the back-end systems the service will need to integrate with.
* Provide the team with access to the specialist expertise it needs (for example legal, policy or industry-specific analysis - from inside or outside the organisation).
* If the team is working with contractors and outside suppliers, make sure it’s on a sustainable basis.
