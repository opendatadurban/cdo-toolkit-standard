title: 15. Work in the open
---

## Why itâ€™s important

Working in the open is a form of governance. Because modern agile ways of working are organised around iterative delivery and incremental change, governance processes need to be too. It also means that people working on data projects in different parts of the city and beyond can find each other without having to navigate management hierarchies.


## What it means

* Publishing [weeknotes](https://www.thecatalyst.org.uk/resource-articles/weeknotes).
* Holding open 'showcases' with senior stakeholders that show recent changes.
* publishing software code and example screenshots (within the confines of POPIA e.g. with any personal information removed).
