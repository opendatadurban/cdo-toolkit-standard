title: 6. Data access, not data sharing
---

## Why it’s important

‘Data sharing’ is, essentially, copying-and-pasting data from one database to another. The data gets duplicated, which creates redundancy. It can easily get out of sync, which creates problems for users and the teams operating services. With 'data access', data is stored once and accessed via APIs by different users. 


## What it means

* data is managed as a common public resource.
* there are processes, technology and open standards for accessing data.
* services and analysts can request access to data with the reasonable expectation that their request will be granted.
