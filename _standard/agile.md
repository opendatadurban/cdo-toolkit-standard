title: 13. Use agile, iterative ways of working
---

## Why it’s important

Using agile methods means getting outputs in front of real users as soon as possible. Based on real users feedback, we can observe and generate data on how they use it before iterating the output based on what we’ve learnt.

Because you’re not specifying everything up front before you’ve developed an understanding of what users need, agile methods reduce the risk of delivering something that does not meet the needs of users and/or reduces the administrative burden for them.


## What it means

* Not specifying everything up-front. Learn while doing.
* Being clear about the type of value you are trying to create (this is normally some combination of meeting the needs of users, reducing administrative burdens, meeting a policy intent, and capacity building).
* Working in one or fortnightly sprints where the aim is to deliver real-world value at the end of each sprint.
* Prioritising work based on what you are learning.
* Having regular showcases that senior stakeholders attend.
