title: 3. Support data-driven decision making

## Why itâ€™s important

The lack of good quality data can result in slow decision making and a lack of accountability. Data can help decision makers make better decisions that, in turn, lead to better outcomes for the public. Some decisions may be automated or semi-automated if appropriate safeguards are in place.

## What it means

* Decision makers have access to the information they need.
* The city has appropriately skilled analysts.
* There is an audit trail of the data and software used to make informed decisions.
* The process is fully replicable, independent of the technology used.
