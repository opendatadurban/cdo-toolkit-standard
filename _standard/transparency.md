title: 9. Be transparent about how data is used
---


## Why itâ€™s important
Data is inherently opaque. It should be clear to decisions makers what data they are using to make decisions. It should be clear to residents how data about them is used.


## What it means
* Citing the sources of data used alongside analyses and visualisations.
* Publishing information about what datasets different services use.
* Publishing the software code for analyses and automated decisions.
* Explaining to users of services how data about them will be used at the point of use.
* Understanding that the city is the custodian of all data that ultimately belongs to residents.
