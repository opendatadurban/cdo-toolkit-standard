## Why itâ€™s important
Digital and data work can be seen as 'innovative' on its own terms without having any real-world impact. To avoid this, the desired outcomes for data work should be documented (for example, increased uptake of services, less water leaks, etc). Those outcomes may change as you learn more through iterative development and user research. 

## What it means
* Documenting what the desired outcomes are for data-related work.
* Restating outcomes and vision alongside analyses.
