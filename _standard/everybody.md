## Why itâ€™s important

Services, reports and analyses ("Outputs) that use data must work for everyone who needs to use them including differently-abled persons and marginalised groups. Outputs that are inclusive, and accessible are better for everyone.


## What it means

* Meet accessibility standards, including both online and offline parts.
* Allow data to be collected and presented in multiple languages.
* Allow data to be collected and presented in multiple formats.
* Carry out research with participants who represent the potential audience for the service, including people with access needs.
