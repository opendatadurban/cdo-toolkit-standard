title: 4. Collect the right data the first time
---

## Why itâ€™s important

If a service collects data in formats that are bespoke, proprietary or vary between channels (for example different data is collected via paper forms, web and text channels), it has implications for the operation of the service. It also means the data is harder to use for other purposes. Increasing the quality of data at the source can improve downstream outcomes.


## What it means

* Lowering the cost of services collecting data digitally by operating 'common components' for things like web forms and text messaging.
* Collecting the same data across channels (analog and digital).
* Setting design standards for form design.
* Using agreed data standards and identifiers.
